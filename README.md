## Discord Bot moderation
Utlizing 
https://github.com/o7-Fire/NodeNsfwJSAPI for checking images for NSFW;\
https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/ for text classification for NSFW;\
https://console.cloud.google.com/ works with dialogflow.

## train your own text classification for now (until we find how to make it into api)
## Cut moderators in half and save your 70% of your bullshit everytime moderators goes slacking when someone spreading NSFW content in general with only python knowledge and brain
